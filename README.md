# MIT Pacmen Exercise
## PacMen exercise for MIT MERN Bootcamp - Description:

Allows a user to generate an infinite number of "PacMen" that bounce around the screen, using the browser window's coordinate system to simulate positions and velocities.

## How to Run

1. Download / clone the repo 
2. Open the "index.html" file in a browser. 
3. Use the "Add PacMan" button to add PacMan images.
4. Use the "Start Game" button to activate PacMan movement. "Start Game" can be pressed over and over again to increase velocity.
5. Refresh the window to start over. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements 

Future updates will include: 
1. Graphical animations to simulate open / closing mouth movements 
2. The ability for PacMen to "eat eachother" upon collision.
